# Grids for days

* We leanrned a new way to format a page in CSS called grid.
* Grid is a powerful tool that allows us to more explicitly tell the html where we want the content placed 
* it does this by making grid lines and that create content boxes(similar to flexbox but more powerful).

# Japanese grid

* We had a set of pictured that needed to be placed and aligned according to the example given by colin.

* At first it was just  a few pictures but then it grew to 44.

* We accomplished this by using grid-template-row and grid-template-column.
